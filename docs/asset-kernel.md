# 糖包 Asset Kernel

The asset library is a view over a shared local asset kernel. Generation, Agent, SOP, post-processing, compositing, export and external integrations use the same command and identity model.

## Identity and storage

- `Asset` is the stable logical record used by UI, commands and `tangbao://assets/{id}` URIs.
- `Blob` is content-addressed by the image hash and owns the physical file metadata.
- `Version` connects one logical asset to a blob and records rendition ancestry.
- `Origin`, parent asset ids and usage events preserve generation and production history.
- Electron stores the searchable catalog in `asset-kernel.sqlite` with FTS5 and cursor pagination. Image bytes remain in the existing content-addressed file cache.
- PWA keeps the same repository and command interfaces with IndexedDB-backed fallback queries.

Machine-generated vectors and perceptual hashes live in separate rebuildable index tables with model id, model version and generation time. They never overwrite user tags or source facts.

## Local REST API

The API is disabled by default. Enable it from **Settings → Data Management → Asset Kernel API**. The panel shows the loopback URL and installation-scoped bearer token.

Security properties:

- listens only on `127.0.0.1`;
- requires `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on every route;
- rejects non-loopback browser origins;
- accepts only allowlisted non-destructive UI commands;
- limits JSON request bodies to 64 KiB;
- never exposes an unauthenticated delete endpoint.

Endpoints:

- `GET /v1/assets?query=&cursor=&limit=`
- `GET /v1/assets/{id}`
- `GET /v1/assets/{id}/content` (authenticated byte stream; metadata responses do not expose local paths)
- `GET /v1/recommendations?query=&context=&similarTo=&limit=`
- `POST /v1/commands`
- `GET /v1/events` (server-sent `asset.created`, `asset.derived`, `asset.updated` events)
- `GET /v1/openapi.json`

Example command body:

```json
{
  "action": "useAsReference",
  "assetId": "asset:..."
}
```

Asset actions are `useAsReference`, `openInPostprocess`, `openInComposite`, `reuseGenerationConfig`,
`exportAsset`, `createCollection` (requires `name`, optional `parentId`) and `importExternalFiles`
(requires `paths`).

App-level actions read and edit the live workspace instead of a specific asset:

- `getAppState` — returns `appMode`, `activeTabId` and every workspace tab with its prompt, params and task count;
- `setPrompt` — writes the prompt of the active tab (requires `prompt`);
- `setParams` — merges generation params into the active tab (requires `params`; only keys present in
  `DEFAULT_PARAMS` are accepted).

Both writes accept an optional `tabId` to switch tabs first, so the change is visible where the user is looking.
They require the app window to be open — unlike the read-only catalog endpoints, they are executed by the renderer.

## MCP stdio server

Launch the installed 糖包 executable with:

```text
糖包.exe --asset-mcp
```

The stdio server implements MCP protocol revision `2025-06-18` and exposes:

- resource template `tangbao://assets/{id}`;
- `search_assets`;
- `get_asset`;
- `recommend_assets`;
- `get_app_state` (read-only workspace snapshot);
- `run_asset_command`;
- `export_asset` (copy-only and refuses to overwrite an existing file).

The MCP process is exempt from the single-instance lock so it can run alongside an open 糖包 window —
`run_asset_command` and `get_app_state` are only useful against a live renderer. It reads
`asset-api.json` from `userData` and talks to the loopback REST API, so that API must be enabled.

Commands that affect the active workspace require the authenticated local REST API to be enabled. Read-only catalog tools and direct export continue to work against SQLite without opening the renderer.

## Rebuild and migration behavior

The first Electron startup after this migration copies existing IndexedDB asset metadata into SQLite in bounded batches. Existing public asset ids remain valid; missing blob and version identities are filled without rewriting legacy links. The machine index can be deleted and rebuilt from asset metadata and local image files.
